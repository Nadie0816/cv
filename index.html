    and placing it in the source (src). The downside to this way is if the website is down from where you took the image address
    you're image will not be available. #2 (The best option) Save the image in the same location your html webpages are saved for example in
    the Web Development Folder, in the HTML Personal Site Folder. Drag the image into the folder, you can now refer to the file name in the
    html folder. If there is an Images folder, you would need to write a path to get to the folder i.e. images/briana.png. crop-circle.imageonline.co
    will be able to crop circle images.
    The alternative (alt) - is the alternative text is what will appear if the image is not available to the website to be rendered

        <p>The inspiration for my work comes from my interactions with people of other cultures, technology, nature, and photography to give a few examples.
          The variety in my inspirations and concepts are shown throughout my work. In each project I try to develop my skills and push my abilities further.
          Fashion should have variety, to change with consumer's mood, and the ability to have an impact on someone's life and wardrobe.</p>
